Guided by Professor [Eric Miller](https://civmin.utoronto.ca/home/about-us/directory/professors/eric-miller/), I am a postdoctoral fellow at the [Mobility Network](https://www.mobilitynetwork.utoronto.ca/), *Department of Civil and Mineral Engineering, University of Toronto*. I earned my Bachelor's in Traffic Engineering from *Beijing Jiaotong University* (北京交通大学) in 2018 and my PhD in Transportation Engineering from *Tongji University* (同济大学) in 2024. Between 2022 and 2023, I also served as a visiting Researcher at the *University of Waterloo*, supervised by Professors [Liping Fu](https://uwaterloo.ca/civil-environmental-engineering/profile/lfu) and [Chris Bachmann](https://uwaterloo.ca/civil-environmental-engineering/profile/c2bachma).

Addressing the formidable challenge of effectively mitigating traffic congestion in metropolitan cities, my doctoral dissertation focuses on leveraging passenger electric vehicles in Shanghai, along with their extensive, continuous trajectories. I introduced a novel methodology to conceptualize and assess the adjustability of vehicle trips, and pioneered differential and targeted strategies for managing vehicle travel demand, grounded in an advanced route choice model. This research was conducted under the supervision of Professors [Xiaohong Chen](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Xiaohong-Chen-5) and [Quan Yuan](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Quan-Yuan-40).

My research focuses on creating sustainable, advanced urban transportation systems and communities. It involves **analyzing individual travel behavior**, **modeling travel demand**, and **studying transportation-land use interactions**. I specialize in urban analytics, utilizing GIS, big data, spatial and econometric modeling, machine learning, and **freight and logistics activities are my primary interests**.
